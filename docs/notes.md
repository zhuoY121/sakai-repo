# Notes

## Search a file

**In IDEA:**

Search for code: Double shifts
Search for string (global search): cmd + shift + f

Note: ```cmd + shift + f``` is more powerful than ```double shift``` 

**Search for HTML files:**

- Use developer tools in Browsers to find the source code of the target.
- Copy some unique string/pattern/id in the source code.
- Do global search within the project directory.
